  <h2>Australia Overview</h2>

    Cultural Geography<br>
    1 March 2024<br>
    <br>
    <strong>Introduction &amp; History</strong><br><br>
    Australia, officially known as the Commonwealth of Australia, is located in the southern hemisphere and is the world's seventh-largest country by total area. Australia is known for its landscapes, wildlife, and vibrant cities. Throughout history, Australia has evolved from its Native roots, through British colonization, to become a modern and multicultural nation. Its history is marked by both successes and challenges, including the impact of colonization on Native peoples, and the development of a successful democracy.<br><br>
    The Native Australians have lived on the Australian continent for a long time. Their way of life, culture, and traditions have been passed down from generation to generation, allowing them to maintain a connection to the land. However, when the British arrived in 1788, they began to colonize the land, leading to a loss of land, culture, and lives for the Native peoples. This history has shaped the country's current political, social, and cultural landscape.<br><br>
    <strong> 1850</strong> - William Tipple Smith found gold in Australia that brought people from around the world to Australia, bringing more than 500,000 people. Most of the people coming were British, but there were also people traveling from across the world to seek riches. (6)<br>
    <br>
    <strong> 1901</strong> - The year Australia became a nation. The British actually suggested that Australia become a separate nation to protect itself from the rule of other countries such as China and Germany, but the people did not want to leave the UK. The people of Australia finally decided to become independent in 1901; the queen signed a paper, and no one was killed.<br>
    <br>
    <strong> 1945</strong> - Australia became one of the founding members of the United Nations.<br>
    <br>
    <strong>Geography</strong><br><br>
    Australia has a diverse geography. Because it is such a large country, Australia is the planet's sixth-largest country after Russia, Canada, China, the USA, and Brazil. At 7,688,287 km² (6), it has vast deserts, lush tropical forests, sprawling coastal plains, and rugged mountain ranges. The continent is surrounded by the Indian and Pacific Oceans, with the Coral Sea and Tasman Sea to the northeast and southeast. Australia is the smallest continent, in terms of land area, and the third largest country (2). It is mostly made up of the "outback", which is a region of desert and semi-arid land (3). This results in an increased population density in the southeast area and a very sparse population in the "outback" areas; 86.6% of the total population lives in urban areas (2).<br><br>
    The Great Dividing Range, running parallel to the eastern coastline, is one of Australia's most notable mountain ranges. It stretches over 3,500 kilometers and is home to a variety of flora and fauna. Major rivers flow through the southeastern part of the country, supporting agricultural regions. The Murray-Darling Basin is the largest river system in Australia and is a vital source of water for the country's agricultural industry. Australia shares maritime borders with Indonesia, East Timor, Papua New Guinea, and New Zealand.<br><br>
    <strong>Government</strong><br><br>
    Australia operates under a federal parliamentary democracy and a constitutional monarchy. The head of state is the British monarch, represented by a Governor-General, while the head of government is the Prime Minister. The capital city is Canberra, located in the Australian Capital Territory. The Parliament of Australia consists of two houses: the House of Representatives and the Senate. Currently, Scott Morrison serves as the Prime Minister.<br><br>
    The judicial system in Australia is made up of federal and state courts, with the Federal Court of Australia handling cases related to federal law and the state and territory courts dealing with issues of state and territory law. The legal profession in Australia is regulated by different independent bodies such as the Law Council of Australia and the state and territory Law Societies. Australia's legal system is designed to ensure justice for all citizens and to protect their rights. Australia's legal system is based on the British common law system. The High Court of Australia is the highest in the country and is responsible for interpreting the Constitution. The court system is independent of the government and ensures that the rule of law is upheld.<br><br>
    <strong>Demographics</strong><br><br>
    Australia is a diverse nation with a population of over 25 million people. Most of the residents are of European ancestry. However, the country has a significant Indigenous population, with 29.9% being native to Australia, as well as a large number of immigrants from all over the world. The country experiences high levels of urbanization, about 86.6%, with the majority of people residing in major cities such as Sydney and Melbourne.<br><br>
    English is the primary language, although Australia is also home to numerous Native languages and a multitude of immigrant communities speaking various languages. The country has a very high standard of living, with a low infant mortality rate of 3 deaths to 100,000 live births and a high life expectancy of 83.3 years (2). The healthcare system operates on public funding and ensures that all citizens and permanent residents have universal access to healthcare.<br><br>
    <strong>Economy</strong><br><br>
    According to the official Australian Government page, “Before the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020, Australia recorded 28 straight years of annual economic growth and was the world's 14th largest economy.” (6) Australia has a mixed-market economy, which means that the economic system is split between capitalist and socialist types, much like the US economic system (5). In a mixed-market economy, the government and people have generally the same amount of power in terms of managing resources and the functioning of markets. Australia is heavily reliant on tertiary businesses, particularly finance, education, tourism, and healthcare. Additionally, the country is a huge exporter of natural resources such as coal, iron ore, gold, and agricultural products. The nation's GDP now ranks among the top 20 globally (2).<br><br>
    Despite facing economic challenges during COVID when they made the mistake of keeping people working in tertiary businesses from home, Australia maintains a robust and resilient economy with a relatively low unemployment rate and a steadily increasing GDP per capita.<br><br>
    Australia is a member of the G20, the World Trade Organization, and the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD). The country has a strong financial sector, with the Australian Securities Exchange (ASX) being the 16th largest stock exchange in the world, giving companies more traction in Australia and being the most popular market for Americans investing overseas (5).<br><br>
    <strong>Military</strong><br><br>
    Australia's commitment to defense is not only evident through its well-equipped military but also in its strategic alliances. The ANZUS Treaty, signed in 1951 between Australia, New Zealand, and the United States, remains a cornerstone of Australia's security policy. This treaty obligates each member to consider an armed attack against any of the others, in the Pacific area, as a threat to its own security, and to act accordingly to meet the common danger. This agreement underscores the importance of cooperation in maintaining regional stability and security.<br><br>
    The ADF (Australian Defence Force), with its modern capabilities, participates in various international peacekeeping and humanitarian missions. Its involvement ranges from combating piracy in the Indian Ocean to providing disaster relief in the aftermath of natural disasters across the Asia-Pacific region. Australia's defense strategy extends beyond its immediate borders, recognizing the interconnectedness of global security.<br><br>
    The ADF's modernization efforts focus on enhancing its capabilities to address evolving security challenges, such as cyber security. This includes investments in advanced naval vessels, fighter jets, cyber defense, and intelligence capabilities. The ADF is also actively involved in joint military exercises and training programs with its allies, fostering interoperability and readiness for joint operations.<br><br>
    Australia's defense spending, amounting to 2% of its national budget (2), reflects its commitment to maintaining a capable and agile military force. This investment not only ensures the nation's security but also contributes to regional and global security efforts. By leveraging its strategic partnerships and investing in modernization, Australia continues to play a vital role in promoting peace and stability in the Asia-Pacific region and beyond.<br><br>
    <strong>Foreign Policy</strong><br><br>
    Australia's foreign policy prioritizes promoting regional stability, economic prosperity, and the advancement of shared values such as democracy and human rights. The nation's strong relations with key allies like the United States and the United Kingdom (2) bolster its diplomatic efforts on the global stage. Actively participating in international forums such as the United Nations, G20, and ASEAN, Australia plays a significant role in maintaining global peace and stability (6).<br><br>
    Moreover, Australia strategically engages with emerging powers such as China and India to cultivate mutually beneficial relationships while addressing regional security challenges like terrorism and maritime disputes (6). This approach aligns with Australia's commitment to promoting security and cooperation in the Asia-Pacific region (6).<br><br>
    <strong>Culture</strong><br><br>
    Australia's culture is a diverse blend of Native traditions, British heritage, and multicultural influences from immigrants. The country celebrates a range of cultural events and festivals that reflect its multiculturalism, such as Australia Day, Anzac Day, and Harmony Day. Australian cuisine uses lots of Native ingredients, European culinary traditions, and Asian flavors, with popular dishes including meat pies, seafood, and barbecue.<br><br>
    Australia is also known for its love of sports, with cricket, rugby, and Australian rules football being some of the most popular. The country has a rich artistic heritage, including Indigenous art, music, and literature. Australian cinema and television are renowned for their unique storytelling and contributions to global entertainment.<br><br>
    The nation's commitment to preserving its natural environment is evident in its vast network of national parks and protected areas. Australia is home to some of the world's most iconic natural landmarks, including the Great Barrier Reef, Uluru, and the Outback, which are integral to its cultural identity and tourism industry.<br><br>
    <strong>Conclusion</strong><br><br>
    In summary, Australia's multifaceted history, diverse geography, and modern governance structure have shaped it into a unique and influential nation. Its rich cultural heritage, strong economy, and commitment to regional and global partnerships make it a significant player on the world stage. As Australia continues to navigate the complexities of the 21st century, its resilience and adaptability will undoubtedly play a crucial role in its ongoing development and global presence.<br><br>
